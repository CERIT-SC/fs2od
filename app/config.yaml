## Test mode
# When test mode is allowed (set to True) all instances (spaces, tokens, groups, ...) are created with a given prefix,
# which value is set by testModePrefix. These instances with a prefix can be deleted in bulk by command:
# python3 test.py --remove_instances some_prefix
testMode: True
testModePrefix: "test123_"

## Waiting
# It can take a while when Onedata compoments register changes which are made by call of API. 
# Therefor there are a pauses between some functions. You can set time of waiting.
# 0 = don't sleep (only testing without Onedata)
# 1 = wait only a while (testing on small datasets)
# 10 = normal production value
